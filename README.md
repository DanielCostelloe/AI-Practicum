•	For an outside Artificial Intelligence (AI) company, developed models for detection of tumors in breast ultrasound images, and classified as benign or malignant.
•	Trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by programming in Python, PyTorch, and torchvision.
•	Machine learning using Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
•	Conducted Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the main effects and interactions among hyperparameters in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, enhancing model performance and optimization.
